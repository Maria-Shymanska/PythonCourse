# Let's say we need to calculate the electricity consumption services.
# In the variable rate, we have an electricity tariff of 1.68, and in the variable value,
# we have the value of the meter reading, set it to a reasonable integer in kilowatts.
# Calculate and place the electricity bill in the variable payment.

value = 6
payment = rate * value

# Let's concatenate these two variables through a space character and put the result in a variable full_name.

# The length variable contains the length, and the width variable contains the width of the room.
# It is necessary to calculate the area of the room and place the result in the variable area.
# Add a show variable in which you place a line with the following pattern:
# 'With width <width> and length <length> of the room, its area is equal to <area value>'.
