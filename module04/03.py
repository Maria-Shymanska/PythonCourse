# We have a list of students' indicators in the group â€“ this is a list with the test scores received.
# It is necessary to divide the list into two parts. Write a split_list function that takes a list (integers),
# finds the average of the score in the list, and divides it into two lists. The first one includes values less than the average,
# including the average, while the second one is strictly higher than the average. 
# The function returns a tuple of these two lists. For an empty list, return two empty lists.
